/// against the real endpoint on 2026-07-16 (3 departures per network), that was

///
///   served 3/3  Rhein-Neckar (Heidelberg), Rhein-Ruhr (Essen), Nürnberg,
///               Dresden — real cars with metre positions; the Rhein-Neckar
///               S-Bahn even comes back as coupled portions with different
///               destinations (S1 Homburg / S3 Germersheim)
///   served 0/3  Hamburg, Berlin, München, Stuttgart, Rhein-Main → 404
///
/// Where a network serves nothing the endpoint 404s and the app stays quiet,
/// exactly as it already does for a regional train's terminus. DB's own board
/// flag `wagenreihung: true` is NOT a shortcut here — München, Stuttgart and
/// Frankfurt set it and then 404.
