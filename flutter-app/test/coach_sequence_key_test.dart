/// What identifies ONE Wagenreihung (#32).
///
/// The rule comes from measuring the live vehicle-sequence endpoint on
/// 2026-07-16, not from DB's docs (there are none): the run is selected by
/// `date` + category + number + evaNumber, and `time` is ignored outright —
/// ICE 205 @ Köln Hbf answered byte-identically for every time from −12 h to
/// +12 h while `date` stayed the service date, and answered 404 as soon as
/// `date` moved a day.
///
/// The app derives `date` from the same DateTime it sends as `time`, so asking
/// with a LIVE time is harmless right up to the moment a delay pushes it past
/// midnight — then it silently asks for tomorrow's run and the Wagenreihung
/// vanishes exactly when the rider needs it.
