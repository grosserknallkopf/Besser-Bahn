// The four tabs lie side by side on one strip, and the app pans along it.
//
// They are StatefulShellRoute branches in a PageView, so the strip is real: you
// can drag it, and a jump travels the whole distance instead of cutting one
// screen-width. What that costs is nested horizontal gestures — the Bahnhof tab
// is a TabBarView with a map in it — so the strip deliberately refuses the
// finger there; that refusal is pinned below, because the honest limitation is
// the feature, and a later "fix" that half-restores the swipe would be worse
// than not having it.
//
// REGRESSION: the tab change was once an AnimatedSwitcher in the shell, holding
// the outgoing child for 260 ms. go_router hands a plain ShellRoute the same
// GlobalKey'd child every build, so that put one key in the tree twice on EVERY
// tab switch. Branch Navigators are separate trees and cannot clash that way —
// the `takeException` checks stay to keep it that way.
