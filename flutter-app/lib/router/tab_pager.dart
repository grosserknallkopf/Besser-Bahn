/// This is the container for [StatefulShellRoute]'s branch Navigators: a
/// [PageView] over all four of them, so the tabs are not four pages taking
/// turns on one spot but one horizontal strip the app pans along. Two things
/// fall out of that, and both are the point:
///
///  * **The finger works.** Drag sideways and the next tab comes with it,
///    tracking the drag, and the route follows where you let go.
///  * **A jump travels the distance.** Tapping Profil from Suche pans across
///    Reisen and Bahnhof instead of teleporting one screen-width — you see how
///    far you went, which is what tells you where you are.
///
/// Each branch keeps its own Navigator, so each tab keeps its own stack, scroll
/// offset and state while it is parked off-screen; go_router wraps every branch
/// in an `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` proxy for exactly this kind of sliver
/// container, so the PageView cannot throw a tab away by scrolling it out.
///
/// Replaces the old `tab_slide.dart`, which faked this with a per-page
/// [CustomTransitionPage]: one page in, one page out, always exactly one
/// screen-width no matter how far the jump, and nothing to grab.

  /// scrollables. Index 2 (Bahnhof) is a `TabBarView` of Zug / Abfahrten /
  /// Karte, and its Karte page is a `FlutterMap` that swallows horizontal drags
  /// whole. So on that tab a sideways drag was never going to reach this strip
  /// from the body anyway — but it *would* have reached it from the chrome
  /// above, which is worse than not working: a swipe that depends on where your
  /// thumb landed. We take the choice instead of letting the arena take it: on
  /// Bahnhof the sideways drag belongs to the inner tabs, full stop, and the
  /// nav bar is how you leave. Everywhere else the strip is yours.
