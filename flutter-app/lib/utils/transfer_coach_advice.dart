/// Where in the arriving train to stand so the change at a transfer stop is a
/// step across the platform instead of a sprint down it (#27).
///
/// WHAT THIS RESTS ON
/// ------------------
/// German platform sections (Abschnitt A–G) are letters painted on the platform
/// itself, not on the track: both tracks of one island platform share the SAME
/// markers at the SAME place. The Wagenreihung proves it — Berlin Hbf, one
/// island, the two tracks come back with the same letter→metre table:
///
///   Gleis 3: G 0–97.5  F 97.5–149.8  E 149.8–194.6  …  A 358.8–430.2
///   Gleis 4: G 0–97.5  F 97.5–149.8  E 149.8–195.7  …  A 358.8–430.2
///
/// So when the arriving and the departing train stand at one platform, their
/// `platformPosition` metres live in a shared frame and can be compared
/// directly: the part of the arriving train that overlaps the departing train's
/// span is the part you want to be in.
///
/// Note the letter order is per-platform, not universal — Hamburg Dammtor Gl. 4
/// runs A(0)→G(420), Dortmund Gl. 16 runs G(0)→A(415). That's why everything
/// here works in METRES and only uses the letters as labels.
///
/// WHEN IT DELIBERATELY SAYS NOTHING (returns null)
/// -----------------------------------------------
/// A wrong section costs exactly the minutes it means to save, so every one of
/// these is a silence, not a guess:
///  * either Wagenreihung is missing — the vehicle-sequence endpoint does not
///    serve every train at every stop (a regional train's terminus 404s).
///  * the two trains are NOT on one platform. DB's own
///    `weiterfahrtAmGleichenBahnsteig` is the only trustworthy source for that
///    (Gleis 4→5 can be one island while 8→9 is two). Across two platforms the
///    sector letters are unrelated frames, and working out which END of platform
///    16 is nearest platform 11 needs station geometry we don't have here.
///  * the two sector tables disagree on where a shared letter sits (> 15 m).
///    Then the frames are not the one platform we were told they are, and the
///    comparison would be nonsense.
///  * the arriving train stands entirely alongside the departing train. Every
///    door already faces it, so there is nothing to optimise and the hint would
///    be noise.
///  * the answer would name every section the arriving train occupies. Two
///    400 m ICEs at one platform produce exactly that ("be in A–G"), which is
///    the train restated as a tip. Real case: Erfurt Hbf ICE 698 → ICE 604.
///
/// This function is pure: hand it the two sequences AT THE TRANSFER STOP.
